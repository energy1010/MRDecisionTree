Interesting aspects of the implementation of StocksMonitor are discussed

Any <a href="http://www.javapractices.com/feedback/FeedbackAction.do?Operation=Show">comments
or suggestions for improvement</a> are always welcome. All alterations
will be credited both in this javadoc, and in the <tt>About</tt> dialog,
if you include your name. These members of the Java community have contributed
suggestions for the improvement of this application :

<p>This application may be launched using a Java Web Start <a href="../StocksMonitor.jnlp">launch
point</a>. Clients require the following software :
<ul>
<li>JRE 1.5.0 (or better)</li>
</ul>

Like Swing itself, most classes in this application are not designed for
multi-threaded environments. Classes which have special status regarding
threads will include the appropriate documentation.

<p>The implementation uses the following coding style :
<ul>
<li>classes are <tt>final</tt> by default ; the only non-<tt>final</tt> classes
are abstract base classes which are explicitly designed for subclassing</li>
<li>a naming convention is used to distinguish fields (<tt>fBlah</tt>) and
arguments (<tt>aBlah</tt>) from local variables (<tt>blah</tt>)</li>
<li>collections are highly preferred over arrays</li>
<li>private members are placed last, not first (This allows the exported API,
which is much more important than the implementation, to appear at the
top.)</li>
<li>all objects are non-<tt>null</tt> unless otherwise specified</li>
<li>classes are package-private by default, and have their scope increased
to <tt>public</tt> only if necessary</li>
</ul>

<P>Known Bugs : please see the application's <tt>Help->About</tt> dialog for
the list of known bugs.

<P>Version History
<ul>
 <li>Version 1.5.0 - published July 2008. This version is mostly a port of the application to JDK 1.5.
 <li>Version 1.0.1 - published May 2003. 
</ul>
